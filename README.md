The task involved creating software for goNature, a company managing multiple nature reserve parks. This software aimed to streamline park management by tracking future reservations, including capacity and financial aspects. Users could easily make reservations and receive notifications regarding success or failure due to capacity constraints. Additionally, the software catered to employees, offering varied functionalities based on their roles. These functionalities included scanning visitors' reservations at park entrances and generating revenue or capacity reports. Both server-side and client-side components were developed as separate projects to ensure efficiency and effectiveness.
